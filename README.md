uBlock Origin list that Disables Youtube's Experimental UI on Desktop.\
stop Youtube Experimenting on you, you are not their Lab Rat, Take back your Freedom

### Installation

#### uBlock Origin filters

Use a browser that supports extensions/add-ons (I Recommend Firefox or forks of Firefox) and install uBlock Origin (Best adBlocker but it's not just an adBlocker)\
Now go to uBlock Origins Settings > Filter Lists > scroll down > Import > copy and paste the link below\
[Fix Youtube UI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sepehrkiller/FixYoutubeUI/main/FixYoutubeUI.txt)

alternatively you can copy all of the filters and add them to **My filters** section of uBO but if you do that then you have to manually update the filters yourself


#### userscripts

I have not made any userscripts, but there are other ones
